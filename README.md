### Hey, I’m Pratham Chellani '(aka prat)' (@AESiR-0)

Full-stack developer. Design enjoyer. System-overthinker.  
Started building websites in 10th grade and never really stopped — still trying to make pixels behave and servers not explode.

Currently juggling product, design, and development across multiple projects (because sleep is overrated, right?).

- 🛠️ Building [DaftarOS](https://github.com/AESiR-0) — a platform connecting founders, investors, and scouts, with just the right amount of chaos
- 🎨 Designed & developed beautiful frontends like:
  - [Mad Labs](https://mad-labs-iota.vercel.app)
  - [TUD Ai Landing Page](https://tud-may.vercel.app/demo_2)
  - [Team K Landing Page](https://cbdind.vercel.app)
  - [Ideal Image Landing Page](https://idealimage-aesthetics.com)
- 🧱 Working with Postgres, sprinkling in some NoSQL magic when things get weird
- 🧠 Currently exploring system architecture (read: breaking things in the name of scalability) and blockchain tech (because why not decentralize your problems?)
