### Hey, Iâ€™m Pratham Chellani (@AESiR-0 or Prat)

Full-stack developer. Design enjoyer. System-overthinker.  
Started building websites in 10th grade and never really stopped â€” still trying to make pixels behave and servers not explode.

Currently juggling product, design, and development across multiple projects (because sleep is overrated, right?).

- Designed & developed beautiful frontends like:
  - [Mad Labs](https://mad-labs-iota.vercel.app)
  - [TUD Ai Landing Page](https://tud-may.vercel.app/demo_2)
  - [Team K Landing Page](https://cbdind.vercel.app)
  - [Ideal Image Landing Page](https://idealimage-aesthetics.com)
- Working with Postgres, sprinkling in some NoSQL magic when things get weird
- Currently exploring system architecture (read: breaking things in the name of scalability) and blockchain tech (because why not decentralize your problems?)
